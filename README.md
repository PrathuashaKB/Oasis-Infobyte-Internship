# Oasis Infobyte Internship 
This repository contains 3 tasks that were completed successfully for the Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

## TASK 1
### IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. With the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species we can train a model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them accordingly with Machine Learning.
#### Dataset :
Iris dataset from **Kaggle** : [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)
#### Project Steps :
1. Data Preprocessing : Load the Iris dataset and inspect its structure.
2. Data Analysis : Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
3. Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training : Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, train each model using the training data.
5. Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.
6. Model Deployment : Using the Streamlit library to create a web-based GUI for the Iris flower classification model.
#### UI for Iris flower classification:
