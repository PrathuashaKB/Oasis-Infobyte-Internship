# Oasis Infobyte
I had the opportunity to be part of [OASIS INFOBYTE](https://oasisinfobyte.com/), a dynamic and inclusive community dedicated to empowering students through learning and leadership development. Itâ€™s a platform that brings together individuals from diverse backgrounds who share a common goal of growth and innovation. At Oasis Infobyte, the focus is on creating opportunities for real-world learning, student engagement, and fostering shared interests by working on various tasks from their curated [task list](https://www.scribd.com/document/765230528/AICTE-OASIS-INFOBYTE-SIP-TASK-LIST)

## TASK 1
### IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. With the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species we can train a model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them accordingly with Machine Learning.
#### Dataset :
Iris dataset from **Kaggle** : [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)
#### Project Steps :
1. Data Preprocessing : Load the Iris dataset and inspect its structure.
2. Data Analysis : Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
3. Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training : Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, train each model using the training data.
5. Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.
6. Model Deployment : Using the Streamlit library to create a web-based GUI for the Iris flower classification model.
#### UI for Iris flower classification :

## TASK 2
### CAR PRICE PREDICTION
Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. By considering these features we can train a model that can learn from the given data and make predictions accordingly with Machine Learning.
#### Dataset :
Car dataset from **Kaggle** : [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/code/goyalshalini93/car-price-prediction-linear-regression-rfe)
#### Project Steps :
1. Data Preprocessing : Load the car dataset and inspect its structure.
2. Data Analysis : Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
3. Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training : Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, train each model using the training data.
5. Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.
6. Model Deployment : Using the Streamlit library to create a web-based GUI for the car price prediction model.

## TASK 3
### UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during COVID-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. 
#### Dataset :
Unemployment dataset from **Kaggle** : [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india)
#### Project Steps :
1. Data Preprocessing : Load the unemployment in India dataset and inspect its structure.
2. Data Analysis : Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
3. Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training : Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, train each model using the training data.
5. Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.
